v2x_regime,Regime type,Regime type,"How democratic is a regime? This variable evaluates regimes according to two principles. First, how competitive the process of access to power is. A competitive process is characterized by free and fair multiparty elections supported by political and civil liberties such as freedom of expression, right to alternative information and associational freedom. Second, how liberal democratic a regime is. This is characterized by the so called rule of law and the presence of both legislative and judicial constraints on the executive. The end-product is four regime types: Closed autocracy, a regime that holds no elections. Electoral autocracy, a regime that on paper elects the legislative and executive, but these elections are neither free, fair, multiparty in the real sense or supported by the essential political liberties. Electoral democracy, a regime that holds elections for the legislature and executive that are free, fair, multiparty and supported by essential political liberties. Liberal democracy, a regime that fulfils the requirements of electoral democracy, but also live up to the liberal principles of democracy, such as the rule of law, independent judiciary and constraints on the executive. This classification is ordinal, ranging from the most autocratic to the most democratic.","Countries classified as closed or electoral autocracies are expected to have less collections in relation to electoral or liberal democracies. Arguments for why the electoral dimension of a democracy should matter for the number of collections is identical to those supplied for the polyarchy variable. One can expect that liberal democratic regimes perform better than electoral democracies as they have better rule of law. This should make them more likely to conform to international agreements. In situations where these agreements contain decisions on for example better environmental monitoring and setting aside land for conservational purposes, it should have bearing on the the number of collections. Liberal democratic regimes also supply civil liberties such as freedom of movement and physical integrity, which for reasons explained under each topic should contribute to more information collection on biodiversity.",Coppedge et al  (2018); Li & Reuveny (2006),"Use as colour in plot 2, exclude from the dropdown of plot 2"
v2x_polyarchy,Polyarchy,Polyarchy,"To what extent is a country democratic in the electoral sense? This variable is theoretically derived from Dahl's conception of polyarchy, rule by the many. It includes to what degree a regime selects is executive and legislative through popular elections, whether these elections are free and fair, and how widespread the right to vote is. It also measures the presence of freedom of expression and the right to alternative information, and the freedom of association of people to organize themselves in political parties and civil society organizations, despite being potential oppositional forces. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate more electoral democracy.","Countries that are more democratic can be expected to have higher levels of environmental commitments. One type of commitment can be to finance and supply infrastructure for the collection of information on environmental issues, such as biodiversity. Democracies can be exptected to have higher levels of commitment due to freedom of expression, freedom of association and electoral accountability. One reason to expect this is that as democracies put less restriction on information flows, citizens knowledge of environmental issues should be higher. If environmental issues are more salient and discussed among citizens, then political leaders face incentives for investing in for example biodiversity conservation. If not, then citizens and civil society oranizations can put pressure on their leaders for disregarding their interests, either through electoral accountabiltiy or informational campaigns. Through this process, conventional or 'green' parties can find support for prioritizing the enviroment. As democracies to a larger extent allow for civil society organizations to exist, this can have positive effects on information collection as either domestic or international organizations can finance or carry out information collection by their own initative.

v2x_freexp_altinf,Freedom of expression and alternative information,Freedom of expression,"To what extent has a country freedom of expression and alternative sources of information do exist? This include aspects concerning press and media freedom, academic and cultural freedom as well as the freedom for citizens to discuss political matters in public and private spheres. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate more freedom of expression and access to alternative information.","In countries characterized by higher levels of informational freedom and the ability to openly discuss and disseminate information on virtually any aspect, we should expect citizens to be more informed about environmental issues. This can generate higher levels of environmental interest among citizens and subsequently spur engagement for contributing to the information collection of biodiversity related indicators. If information collection potentially is conflictual to the aims or interests of the government, political freedoms such as these should stimulate the collection and dissemination of them, despite the risks.",Coppedge et al. (2018); Chadwick (1995); Payne (1995),
v2x_frassoc_thick,Freedom of association,Freedom of association,"To what extent a country does a country provide freedom of association to its citizens? The variable captures if civil society organizations can operate freely and without fear of repression from the government, and whether new or oppositional political parties are free to take form and participate in elections. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate higher levels of associational freedom.","In countries where people are free to organize themselves, either in civil society organizations or political parties, it is more likely that such organizations with an ecological orientation exist. Especially if there are environmental aspects that further motivate such actions. These collective 'green' actors can play multiple roles in the collection of information. They can facilitate information collection on biodiversity outcomes by gathering support for it through campaigning and lobbying efforts, aimed at both the public and decision-makers. They can engage in information collection themselves or provide necessary infrastructure. Further, these type of political rights should also make it easier for international environmental organizations to operate in the country. ", Coppedge et al. (2018); Binder and Neumayer (2005); Payne (1995),
v2xcl_dmove,Freedom of movement ,Freedom of movement ,"To what extent enjoy citizens formal freedom of movement and residence? The variable gauges aspects such as the right for men and women to move at all times of the day, across regions using public thoroughfares. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate more freedom of movement.","In countries with restrictions on where and how citizens can travel and reside, one can expect the collection of biodiversity related information to face critical impediments. First, by limiting the ways of travelling it can make it harder to reach areas where observations can be made. Second, if certain areas where observations of biodiversity can be made are put under restrictions, it should decrease collections from that area.",Coppedge et al. (2018); Freitag et al. (1998); Meyer et al. (2015) ,
v2xcs_ccsi,Civil society ,Civil society ,"How autonomous is a country's civil society? This variable captures the extent to which a state allows civil society organizations (CSO) to freely organize and operate without being regulated or repressed, if these organizations are included in policy-making processes and if civil society participation is inclusive.","In countries with relatively more robust civil societies, one often find environmental performance in general to be higher. The main reason behind this logic is that CSOs with an ecological orientation can come to exist. Subsequently, they can mobilize ecological 'green' political preferences and call out governments that are not addressing environmental degradation adequately. One can expect that organizations such as these also contribute to higher levels of information collection by pushing governments to better manage their biodiversity, by providing infrastructure that motivate others to collect information or by collecting it themselves.",Coppedge et al. (2018); Bernauer et al. (2013); Shandra et al. (2009),
v2x_corr,Political corruption,Political corruption,"The level of political corruption in a country. This variable includes the extent of corruption within the public sector, the judiciary, the executive and the legislative bodies. As such, this captures different forms of corruption, operating at both grand and petty levels, and aimed at affecting both political decision-making and the implementation of policy. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate more corruption.","In countries characterized by higher levels of political corruption, one can expect that conservational efforts are hampered. Corruption is for example argued to increase the embezzlement of funds for conservational purposes, distort political initiatives away from public goods toward private benefits and create an institutional environment beneficial to illegal activity such as poaching. To the extent that information collection depends on sufficient economic resources and support from public policy, corruption should be negative to the amount of records collected. Further, if poaching is relatively higher in corrupt areas, then it can discourage practitioners and scientist from travelling there and collection information due to safety reasons.",Coppedge et al. (2018); Pellegrini and Gerlach (2006); Smith et al. (2003) Sundstrom (2015),
v2x_clphy,Physical violence index,Physical violence index,"To what extent a regime respects citizens physical integrity? This variable captures to what degree torture and killings for political purposes are carried out by the government. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate lower levels of physical violence.","If countries have relatively low respect for citizens physical integrity, one can expect this to have a negative effect on practitioners and scientists motivations for travelling to these countries. This can be both due to political concerns of citizens well-being but also for personal safety reasons, as the scope of violence potentially can expand to include country visitors.",Amano and Sutherland (2013); Meyer et al. (2015),
e_peaveduc,Average level of education in population older than 15 years,Education 15+,The average level of education among citizens that are older than fifteen years old.,"In countries that are characterized by relatively higher levels of education, one can expect higher levels of environmental awareness, more resources being allocated to educational and scientific purposes, and more sound environmental policy. In turn, this can be beneficial for information collection through higher levels of interest and likely larger allocation of resources to knowledge producing processes.",Coppedge (2018); Amano and Sutherland (2013); Buitenzorgy and Mol (2010); Pellegrini and Gerlach (2006),
e_migdppc,Gross domestic product per capita,GDP per capita,The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in a country.,"In countries with higher levels of economic development, understood here as GDP per capita, one can expect the level of financial resources allocated to science and education to be relatively lower. Thus, the capacity of research institutions to provide infrastructure for the collection of information on biodiversity should be limited. Development is also theorized to be accompanied with environmentalistic values. Thus, more development can lead to a higher interest in environmental issues, which consequently can increase ambitions for and interest in the collection of information.",Bolt et al. (2018); Amano and Sutherland (2013); Desai (1998); Meyer et al. (2015),
e_wri_pa,Protected areas ,Protected areas ,"The share of total land area that is put under conservational status, as defined by the IUCN. It specifically captures terrestrial protected areas.","In countries with a larger proportion of its terrestrial area under protective status, one can expect the information collection of biodiversity to be relatively higher. First, protected areas are often places with great biodiversity and attractive species. As such, they can signal to both practitioners and scientists that interesting observations can be made there. Second, protected areas are often accompanied by relevant infrastructure for explorations, which make it easier for interested actors to make observations. Third, a larger share of protected areas can be a proxy for the presence of relatively higher conservational ambitions within a country. One can expect this to be associated with more collections.",Meyer et al. (2015); Yang et al. (2014),
conf,Conflicts,Conflicts,Did a country experience either an internal armed conflict or a civil war during a given year? Civil war refers to an intra-state conflict that produce at least 1000 battle-deaths during a year. Internal armed conflict a conflict between a non-state actor and the state that resulted in at least 25 battle-related deaths during a year. This variable is binary and takes on the value of one when a conflict event is recorded.,"In countries that are experiencing conflicts one can expect the collection of records to be lower. It is a reasonable expectation that conflicts can disincentivise both scientists from travel to a country and collect records, but also actors originated from within that country to do so. Another expectation is that conflicts are likely to both require resources and degrade the environment itself, which indirectly can impede record collection.",Coppedge et al. (2018); Meyer et al.
