<!-- Abstract -->
Countries are the main actors responsible for mapping and protecting their biodiversity. However, political regimes may differ in their capacity, willingness and efficiency to collect primary biodiversity data necessary for research and conservation. Here we present an online tool for the easy exploration of the links between multiple aspects of democracy, armed conflicts, and other socio-economic variables and the generation and availability of natural history specimens and species observations. Around the world, strong and previously unknown patterns emerge. We urge for increased collaboration between natural and social scientists to further unveil these patterns and underlying processes.  

<!-- Main body -->
Politics can contribute to international differences in the availability of biodiversity data [@Neumayer2002; @McClanahan2016], but political systems do vary [@Geddes2014; @Lindberg2014]. The level of democracy of a country at any given point in time has multiple dimensions, including, for example, suffrage (fraction of citizens with the right to vote), freedom of expression, quality of elections, harassments of journalists [@Coppedge2011; @Coppedge2019]. Although several aspects of democracy are bundled together, there are differences with respect to how countries exhibit different levels of each aspects. Since individual dimensions of democracy might be of different relevance for biodiversity conservation and the availability of biodiversity data [@Bohmelt2015; @Escher2018], it can be misleading to use one-dimensional indicators (such as democratic vs. autocratic) to fully explore the role of politics on biodiversity knowledge. A detailed understanding of individual dimensions of political systems is therefore crucial for exploring specific mechanisms mediating the availability of biodiversity data.

<!-- The degree of democratization of a country has multiple dimensions, including suffrage (the proportion of the population having access to elections), freedom of movement, freedom of expression, freedom of association, among others 

A country may reach different levels of democracy in each of these dimensions, so that, for instance, a country might have low suffrage, but relatively high freedom of expression; or it may have no real elections, but relatively high freedom of movement.-->

The influence of political regimes on biodiversity data may happen via several mechanisms [@Ryden2019]. For instance, the generally more open and reliable legal framework with higher academic freedoms in liberal democracies can make them more accessible for researchers and international collaborations for biodiversity data collection, in relation to less liberal regimes (**REFERENCES**). Free, fair and repeated elections can provide citizens with a means to express their demand for good environmental conditions and thus also incentives for monitoring their biodiversity (**REFERENCE**). In places where the threat of conflict or physical violence is lower one can expect the data collection process to be safer, certainly for international researchers (**REFERENCE**). Countries with higher levels of education might have a higher overall level of environmental awareness. This can have bearing upon the point about elections made above, but might also lead to the development of "citizen science" if the regime is allowing of citizens organizing freely and sharing information, nationally and internationally, which contribute considerably to the availability of biodiversity data (e.g., www.ebird.org, www.inaturalist.org).


<!--For instance, liberal democracies are likely to be more accessible for researchers, allocate more resources to science, provide a more reliable legal framework for data collections, engage in international collaborations for data collection and sharing than autocratic and repressive regimes

Countries with a high level of electoral accountability might have a higher commitment to secure good environmental conditions for voting citizens and hence a higher incentive to allocate resources to biodiversity monitoring and data collection

Countries with lower levels of conflict or physical violence might be safer for biodiversity data collection, especially for international researchers

Countries with higher levels of education might have a higher overall level of environmental awareness and interest in research and hence biodiversity data collection. Countries with higher levels of freedom of association are more likely to develop ecological and naturalist societies ("citizen science") which contribute considerably to the availability of biodiversity data (e.g., www.ebird.org, www.inaturalist.org).-->

Here we present a free software (www.bio-dem.surge.sh) to explore the relationship between the availability of primary biodiversity data (geo-referenced natural history specimens and species observations; obtained from www.gbif.org) with various democratic institutions, indexes and categories [e.g. regime type, "polyarchy", the freedom of expression etc. from @Coppedge2019]. Furthermore, we quantify the proportion of global biodiversity that is managed by different regime types [@Luhrmann2018]. For these analyses, we calculate the area-weighted species richness of three vertebrate groups and seed plants per country globally. Specifically, we ask three questions: 1) Which fraction of the studied biodiversity is managed by democratic or autocratic regimes?; 2) How does the availability of primary biodiversity data relate to the political situation in countries?; and 3) What is the relation between democratization and the availability of primary diversity data through time? 

<!-- Results and Discussion -->
The analyses of distribution data from 22,805 species of vertebrates and >300,000 seed plants show that the majority of globally threatened and non-threatened species (according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature) are managed under democratic regimes, mostly electoral democracies (Fig \ref{fig:biodiversity}a). However, several countries with particularly high biodiversity––-and hence critical importance for conservation––-include autocracies such as China, Venezuela, Madagascar and Papua New Guinea, besides democratic countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Colombia and Peru (Fig. \ref{fig:biodiversity}b). Especially the electoral democracies of South America contribute to a disproportionately large share of global vertebrate diversity under democratic rule (Fig. \ref{fig:biodiversity}c). However, one must not forget the very recent political development in terms of democratic backsliding or populism and what the associated political leaders might do to the natural environment in a broad sense [@Dasgupta2018].

Exploring the availability of biodiversity data in the context of the political regimes around the world reveals several interesting and poorly documented patterns. While the number of __protected areas__ today is largely unrelated to the political regime, the amount of available biodiversity data correlates with polyarchy which is a measure of electoral democracy (Fig. \ref{fig:biodem}a). Similarly, the density of available biodiversity data correlates with the level of education (Fig. \ref{fig:biodem}b). Costa Rica emerges as an outlier, with an outstandingly high density of occurrence records despite the country's relatively low average education length. Conversely, numerous countries formerly part of the Soviet Union stand out by their low number of records but high average education length. 

Many countries have changed political regimes in the course of their history. Bio-dem enables the assessment of how those changes, as well as armed conflicts, affected the availability of primary biodiversity data. Taking Cambodia as an example, we unveil a decrease of such data by orders of magnitude in the 1970s, with the beginning of a period of conflicts and autocratization (Fig. \ref{fig:biodem}c). The end of this period and the corresponding increase in the level of democracy led to an abrupt increase in data availability. Similarly, in India political turmoil and a related decrease in the level of democracy in 1975 and 1976 led to an abrupt decrease in the availability of biodiversity data from national institutions (Fig. \ref{fig:biodem}d). Despite those historical turmoils and a minor recent decline in the level of democracy, Cambodia and India mirror most other countries in exhibiting a general increase in biodiversity data, probably attributable to the widespread use of citizen science applications for mobile phones such as iNaturalist. 

Perhaps not surprisingly, the relationship between political differences, socio-economic variables and biodiversity knowledge emerges as multi-faceted. These links are also likely to be multi-directional, with raising societal concerns for environmental protection being able to affect political processes and biodiversity data gathering. Other relations are less clear, for instance between democracy and data availability (Fig. \ref{fig:biodem}). In general, an interpretation of observed patterns is difficult, due to indirect or unclear mechanisms. The Bio-dem app and its underlying data sources will hopefully provide a useful platform for further research at a global scale and through time. Paramount to this goal will be a tighter collaboration between biologists, conservationists and political scientists. 

# Methods
**Biodiversity and political regimes** We used species geographic ranges as provided by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (www.iucn.org) together with country borders as provided by naturalearth (www.naturalearth.org) to estimate the range weighted species richness for mammals, amphibians and non-marine birds per country. To do so, we first downloaded the ranges for all species (*DOWNLOAD DATE*), excluded marine birds based on expert knowledge, and overplayed the range of each species with country borders. We then divided the size of a species range within each country by the total range size of this species and summed the values for all species per country. For instance, if a species is endemic to a country (i.e., the entire range is within country borders), it adds 1 unit to the countries species richness, and if 10% of a species range is within a country this species increases the country's score by 0.1. We then combined this per country species richness with data on species threat level (www.iucn.org) and with information on the state of democracy in each country for the year 2017 from the Varieties of Democracy project [@Coppedge2019], for the visualizations in Figure 2.

**Software availability.** The results presented here were generated by a novel software developed for this study, the Bio-dem web application (www.bio-dem.surge.sh). Bio-Dem is implemented in Javascript. This is a free app, which allows users to explore the relationship between biodiversity data availability and the state of political regimes across countries globally and through time (since 1900). It also allows the generation of publication level graphs in an easily accessible way. The app includes a large number of political as well as key socio-economic indicators (XX) of expected relevance to biodiversity data collection and mobilization. It further allows faceting the data by time period and biological group. Bio-Dem obtains information on species occurrence records from the GBIF API and data on political indicators from the Varieties of Democracies database version 8. All data shown in Figure 2 are directly exported from Bio-Dem.
