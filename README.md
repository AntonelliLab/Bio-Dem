# Bio-Dem - Biodiversity knowledge & democracy

Bio-Dem is an app to visually explore the availability of geographic occurrence records of biological species available from the 
[Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](www.gbif.org) (as proxy for scientific biodiversity knowledge) in relation to political systems as defined by [V-Dem](https://www.v-dem.net/) around the world. 
Some specific questions that motivated the development of Bio-Dem are:

* Which role do political regimes play for collecting biological specimens (and getting them into GBIF)?

* Do democracies perform better in collecting biodiversity knowledge?

* How important are individual dimensions of regime types, such as freedom of movement, rule of law and strength of the civil society?

* Which role do other factors play, such as national GDP?

* How do conflicts impact record availability
